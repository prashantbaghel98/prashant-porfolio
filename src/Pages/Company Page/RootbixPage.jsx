      {/* Joining & Initial Challenge */}
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I joined Rootbix Infotech as a WordPress Developer in December 2024. At the time of joining, the company's website had several issues. The design was outdated, the layout was not user-friendly, and many pages were not functioning properly. This presented a great challenge and an opportunity for me to make a visible impact.
      </p>

      {/* WordPress Work */}
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        My first responsibility was to redesign the existing WordPress website. I focused on creating a modern, clean, and responsive design that improved the user experience. I also created multiple new pages, added engaging content, and ensured that all existing pages were fully functional. This included fixing broken links, optimizing images, and improving the overall performance of the website. I regularly maintained the site to ensure smooth operation and a seamless experience for visitors.
      </p>

      {/* Transition to MERN Stack */}
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        After a few months, the company decided to rebuild its website using the MERN stack to make it more scalable and modern. I was assigned to this new project and took full responsibility for both the frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I used React.js to create interactive and responsive components. On the backend, I used Node.js and Express to develop APIs and handle server-side logic. I also designed and managed the MongoDB database for storing all website data. This project is currently in the development phase, and I am continuously working to implement new features and improvements.
      </p>

      {/* Ongoing Responsibilities */}
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        In addition to the MERN stack project, I continue to manage the original WordPress website. This includes updating content, fixing bugs, optimizing the website, and ensuring that it remains fully functional for all users. I also collaborate with the design team to improve the visual appearance of the websites and ensure consistency across all pages.
